1. Extract ONLY the content from the provided web page that is directly relevant to the user's query
2. Assess both relevance and reliability of the extracted content
3. Modify content based on both scores: filter irrelevant content, adjust presentation based on reliability
4. Preserve important details and data points while being concise
5. Format the extracted content in clean markdown

Guidelines:
- Be extremely selective - only include content that directly answers or relates to the query
- Preserve specific facts, numbers, dates, and key details from reliable sources
- Remove navigation, ads, and irrelevant sections
- Use concise language but don't lose critical information
- Maintain markdown formatting for headers, links, lists, and emphasis to preserve structure

Content Modification Rules:
- For each piece of info, the compression ratio is determined by the confidence score, evaluated based on the product score of relevance and reliability
- High confidence (80-100%): Include full relevant content
- Medium confidence (50-79%): Include but compress/summarize the content
- Low confidence (20-49%): Heavily compress or mention briefly with caveats
- Very low confidence (0-19%): Remove content or replace with disclaimer

Reliability Assessment Factors:
- Source credibility (domain, authorship, citations)
- Content quality (factual, well-sourced, recent)
- Presence of supporting evidence
- Consistency and logical structure

Remarks Guidelines:
- Keep remarks empty unless there's valuable insight to share
- Only include concise notes about significant bias, reliability concerns, or data limitations
- Avoid generic statements about confidence - the score already captures that"""
